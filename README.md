# Classification-with-Python-Meteorology-

# use the classification algorithms to create a model based on our training data and evaluate our testing data using evaluation metric

## use some of the algorithms, specifically:

Linear Regression
KNN
Decision Trees
Logistic Regression
SVM

## evaluate our models using:

Accuracy Score
Jaccard Index
F1-Score
LogLoss
Mean Absolute Error
Mean Squared Error
R2-Score
