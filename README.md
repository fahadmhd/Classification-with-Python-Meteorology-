## Classification-with-Python-Meteorology | Rain Prediction in Australia

#### we use the classification algorithms to create a model based on our training data and evaluate our testing data using evaluation metric
For this case study, the original source of the data is Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology and the latest data can be gathered from http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/.

### use some of the algorithms, specifically:

* Linear Regression
* KNN
* Decision Trees
* Logistic Regression
* SVM

### evaluate our models using:

* Accuracy Score
* Jaccard Index
* F1-Score
* LogLoss
* Mean Absolute Error
* Mean Squared Error
* R2-Score

The following analysis matrix is constructed in this case study.
